Project 2 Submission: JSON Data Parsing and Presentation with handling features

Word Done: 
1. Created the User Interface.
2. Implemented a feature for users to import data from the downloaded JSON file.
3. Developed display handling options to control the visibility of columns in the data table. Implemented multi-select functionality for users to choose fields to display. Added ">>" and "<<" buttons for adding and removing selected options between Available Fields and Fields to be displayed Lists.
4. Displayed the imported JSON data in a table format. Ordered the displayed data based on descending popularity. Ensured the table includes at least the "Title" and "Price" columns.


Additional Considerations: Ensured a user-friendly and intuitive UI design.

At last the project is hosted on Github pages. Please do give it a try. ğŸ˜Š
